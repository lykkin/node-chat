node-chat
=========


Free standing chat client written in nodejs, using pub/sub functionality from redis.

Has partial IRC integration.

TODO
====


Properly abstract chat module out of the code

Increase/clean-up user functionality (renaming, full irc support, etc)

Fix UI, make it not so fugly

Overall clean up, probably not well optimised/organized.
